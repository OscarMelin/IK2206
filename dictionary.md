###One-time pad
An encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a
one-time pre-shared key the same size as the message being sent. In this
technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a
one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by
combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular
addition.

###Block cipher
In cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on
fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks, with an unvarying transformation
that is specified by a symmetric key. Block ciphers operate as important
elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols, and are
widely used to implement encryption of bulk data.


###Data Encryption Standard
A symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. Although now
considered insecure, it was highly influential in the advancement of modern
cryptography.
